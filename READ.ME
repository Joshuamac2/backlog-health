# 📊 Backlog Visibility & Stakeholder Reporting Tool

As a Product Manager, I often faced challenges tracking the health of our backlog due to inconsistent use of labels in Jira and a lack of reliable tooling for visibility. To address this, I built an internal tool powered by the Jira API to provide a clear overview of the backlog state.

This tool has been invaluable for sprint planning, reducing manual overhead, and improving communication between product teams and stakeholders.



## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Backlog Health Monitoring**  
  Visual dashboards with graphs and data showing what's blocked, ready, or in progress.

- 🏷️ **Label-Agnostic Ticket Filtering**  
  Works with teams using unique or inconsistent Jira labels.

- 📊 **Epic & Story Insights**  
  Tables displaying ticket links, epic groupings, estimated effort, pricing, and importance.

- 📧 **Automated Stakeholder Reporting**  
  Email summaries sent directly to senior stakeholders with a snapshot of current backlog health.

- 🔗 **Quick Navigation to Jira**  
  All items include direct links to their corresponding Jira tickets and epics.
