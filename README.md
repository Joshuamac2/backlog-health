# 📊 Backlog Visibility & Stakeholder Reporting Tool

As a Product Manager, I often faced challenges tracking the health of our backlog due to inconsistent use of labels in Jira and a lack of reliable tooling for visibility. To address this, I built an internal tool powered by the Jira API to provide a clear overview of the backlog state.

This tool has been invaluable for sprint planning, reducing manual overhead, and improving communication between product teams and stakeholders.
